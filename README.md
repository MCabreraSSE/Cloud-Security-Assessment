# Cloud Security Assessment

A cloud security assessment is an evaluation that tests and analyzes an organization’s cloud infrastructure to ensure the organization is protected from a variety of security risks and threats. The assessment is designed to:

Identify weaknesses and potential points of entry within the organization’s cloud infrastructure
Analyze the network for evidence of exploitation
Outline approaches to prevent future attacks
A cloud security assessment typically focuses on the following seven areas:

Overall security posture: Conduct interviews and a documentation review to evaluate the security of enterprise cloud infrastructure
Access control and management: Review identity and access management, including user accounts, roles, and key management
Network security: Review segmentation and firewall policies against common misconfigurations
Incident management: Review incident response policy related to cloud infrastructure, including roles and processes related to an incident
Storage security: Assess posture of cloud storage including object-level storage, block-level storage, and related snapshots
Platform services security: Review security configuration of advanced service offerings specific to each cloud service provider
Workload security: Review security for workloads including virtualized servers, server-hosted containers, functions, and serverless containerized workloads




Minimize Risk of Cyber-attacks
Knowing your weaknesses is the first step towards improving your security posture.
The assessment will help you identify your security weaknesses and vulnerabilities and allow you to build a secure and resilient infrastructure in the cloud.

Ensure Compliance with Security Policies and Standards
Organizations are obligated to follow security standards such as SOC2, ISO-27001, and others.
we can help comply with these standards. We validate that your security settings are implemented effectively and provide recommendations about improving them.

Improve Readiness for Cyber-incidents
Protecting your cloud is a complex ongoing task. Inattention or hastiness may lead to critical mistakes that put your business at risk. Security plans should consider such errors and build the controls to detect and respond to cyber-attacks.
we helps organizations plan and test their cyber-readiness programs in the cloud.

Cloud Architecture
We review the cloud network architecture, VPC definitions, Subnet ACLs, Load Balancing, and more. Architecture also refers to storage, gateways, databases, serverless applications, and more.

Identity Access Management
We test for user management in the cloud, including authentication requirements, password policies, permissions management, third- party access, privileged accounts, and more. 

Application Security
the specializes in Application security. We perform application-level design reviews, security code reviews, and application-layer penetration testing for numerous cloud-native applications. Many of our projects combine application security tests with a cloud security assessment.

Governance, Risk, and Compliance
The cloud audit tracks cloud capabilities, including access logs, network inspection, and cloud services logs such as storage and databases. In addition, we conduct a personal interview and fill out a questionnaire with security officers to understand organizational policies and procedures.

Incident Response
we may simulate an attack to help you train and test your IT in responding to a cyber-attack. Such tests will improve the team’s knowledge in handling security events, improve detection time and  ensure that they are ready to react in case of an actual attack.
